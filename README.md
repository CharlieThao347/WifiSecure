# WifiSecure

WifiSecure is an android application that combines a Wi-Fi scanner and VPN client into one convenient package. With these two functionalities, users can easily find the best Wi-Fi spot near them while also establishing an encrypted connection to it. The app scans for nearby wireless access points and displays relevant information such as SSID, encryption type, frequency, signal strength etc. When connecting to a Wi-Fi spot, users can establish an encrypted connection via the built-in VPN client.

The app is built using Kotlin and a UI framework called Jetpack Compose.
