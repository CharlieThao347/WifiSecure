# WifiSecure

WifiSecure is an android application that combines a Wi-Fi scanner and VPN client into one convenient package. With these two functionalities, users can easily identify nearby Wi-Fi networks best suited to their needs and also establish an encrypted internet connection. The app scans for nearby wireless access points and displays relevant information such as SSID, encryption type, frequency, signal strength etc. Users can establish an encrypted internet connection by connecting to the built-in Wireguard VPN server or by adding and connecting to their own Wireguard VPN server.

The app is built using Kotlin and a UI framework called Jetpack Compose.
